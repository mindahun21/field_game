Learning to Contribute to the Field Game Bot
============================================

This guide is for anyone who wants to contribute to the Field Game Bot project. We welcome contributions from everyone, and we're excited to see what you can bring to the project. This guide will provide you with the information you need to get started, from understanding the project's architecture to learning the necessary technical skills.

Python Concepts
---------------

This project is primarily written in Python. To contribute effectively, you should have a good understanding of the following Python concepts:

**Basic Concepts:**

*   **Variables and Data Types:** Understand how to declare variables and work with different data types, such as strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries.
*   **Control Flow:** Be comfortable with `if` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops.
*   **Functions:** Know how to define and call functions, and understand the difference between arguments and parameters.
*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Have a basic understanding of classes, objects, and inheritance.

**Advanced Concepts:**

*   **Asynchronous Programming:** This project uses `asyncio` for handling asynchronous operations. You should be familiar with the `async` and `await` keywords.
*   **Decorators:** We use decorators for things like database access. Understanding how decorators work will be helpful.
*   **Type Hinting:** We use type hints to improve code clarity and catch errors.

Frameworks and Libraries
------------------------

We use several Python frameworks and libraries in this project. You should familiarize yourself with the following:

*   **FastAPI:** Our API is built with FastAPI. You should understand the basics of creating routes, handling requests, and working with Pydantic models.
*   **SQLAlchemy:** We use SQLAlchemy as our Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for interacting with the database. You should know how to define database models and query the database.
*   **python-telegram-bot:** This is the library we use to interact with the Telegram Bot API. You should be familiar with the `Updater`, `Dispatcher`, and `Handler` classes.

JavaScript Concepts
-------------------

The mini-app is written in JavaScript. To contribute to the mini-app, you should have a good understanding of the following JavaScript concepts:

**Basic Concepts:**

*   **Variables and Data Types:** Understand how to declare variables and work with different data types.
*   **Control Flow:** Be comfortable with `if` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops.
*   **Functions:** Know how to define and call functions.

**Intermediate Concepts:**

*   **DOM Manipulation:** Understand how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to create and modify HTML elements.
*   **Events:** Know how to handle user events, such as clicks and form submissions.
*   **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Be familiar with `Promises` and the `async/await` syntax.

**Advanced Concepts:**

*   **ES6 Modules:** Understand how to use `import` and `export` to organize your code.

Frameworks and Libraries
------------------------

The mini-app is built with the following frameworks and libraries:

*   **React:** Our mini-app is a React application. You should be familiar with React components, state, props, and hooks.
*   **Vite:** We use Vite as our build tool. You should know how to start the development server and build the application for production.

How to Contribute
-----------------

Once you're comfortable with the necessary technical skills, you can start contributing to the project. Here's how:

1.  **Find an issue:** Look for open issues on our GitHub repository. If you have an idea for a new feature, you can create a new issue to discuss it with the maintainers.
2.  **Fork the repository:** Create a fork of the repository to your own GitHub account.
3.  **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch for your changes.
4.  **Make your changes:** Make your changes to the code and commit them to your branch.
5.  **Submit a pull request:** When you're ready, submit a pull request to the main repository.

We're excited to have you as a contributor to the Field Game Bot project!
